## Installation

1. Clone or download this MCP server
2. Install dependencies:

   uv sync
   ```

## Configuration

Add the server to your `.mcp.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "monarch-money": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory", 
        "/path/to/monarch-money-mcp",
        "run",
        "python",
        "server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MONARCH_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
        "MONARCH_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "MONARCH_MFA_SECRET": "your-mfa-secret-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `/path/to/uv` with the full path to your `uv` executable (find it with `which uv`)
- Replace `/path/to/monarch-money-mcp` with the absolute path to this server directory
- Use absolute paths, not relative paths

### Getting Your MFA Secret

1. Go to Monarch Money settings and enable 2FA
2. When shown the QR code, look for the "Can't scan?" or "Enter manually" option
3. Copy the secret key (it will be a string like `T5SPVJIBRNPNNINFSH5W7RFVF2XYADYX`)
4. Use this as your `MONARCH_MFA_SECRET`

## Session Management

The server automatically manages authentication sessions:
- Sessions are cached in a `.mm` directory for faster subsequent logins
- The session cache is automatically created and managed
- Use `MONARCH_FORCE_LOGIN=true` in the env section to force a fresh login if needed

## Troubleshooting

### MFA Issues
- Ensure your MFA secret is correct and properly formatted
- Try setting `MONARCH_FORCE_LOGIN=true` in your `.mcp.json` env section
- Check that your system time is accurate (required for TOTP)

### Connection Issues
- Verify your email and password are correct in `.mcp.json`
- Check your internet connection
- Try running the server directly to see detailed error messages:
  ```bash
  uv run server.py
  ```

### Session Problems
- Delete the `.mm` directory to clear cached sessions
- Set `MONARCH_FORCE_LOGIN=true` in your `.mcp.json` env section temporarily

## Security Notes

- Keep your credentials secure in your `.mcp.json` file
- The MFA secret provides full access to your account - treat it like a password
- Session files in `.mm` directory contain authentication tokens - keep them secure
- Consider restricting access to your `.mcp.json` file since it contains sensitive credentials
